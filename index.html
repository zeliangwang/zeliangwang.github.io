	<p class="lead">I'm a <span itemprop="title">Data Scientist (KTP Associate)</span> 
		in <a href="https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/">School of Computer Science</a> 
		at the <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/">University of Exeter</a>, where I work closely with 
		Dr. <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/jtc202">Jacqueline Christmas</a> and 
		Prof. <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/reverson">Richard Everson</a> on a   
		<a href="https://info.ktponline.org.uk/action/details/partnership.aspx?id=11492">KTP project.</a> 
		The broad aim of the KTP project is to improve energy efficience from 'big' metering data in a 
		more intelligent and efficent way by using advanced machine learning and AI techniques. 
		My research interests cover a wide range of topics in signal processing and machine learning, 
		specialised in statistical modelling, algorithm development, sensor array processing, 
		signal processing for communications, etc.</p>
