		in <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/">School of Computer Science</a> 
		at the <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">University of Exeter</a>, where I work on a KTP project which 
		aims to identify energy savings and improve energy efficience from electricity metering data in a 
		more intelligent and efficent way by using advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques. 
		My research interests cover a wide range of topics in signal processing and machine learning, 
		specialised in statistical modelling, algorithm development, sensor array processing, 
		signal processing for communications, etc.</p>

	<p>Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Research	Associate at Cardiff University (Apr 2018-May 2019). 
		I received a PhD degree in Signal Processing from Cardiff University in 2017.</p>
