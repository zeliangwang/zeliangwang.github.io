I"§<p>This is an overdue note about my switch to using GitHub and Jekyll for this website.</p>

<p>After 10+ years using WordPress I finally made the switch to GitHub Pages (confession: I still use WordPress for certain projects at work). My switch largely centered around this rant that played itself out quite frequently in my head:</p>

<p>When you want something simple, having a WordPress site often comes with a lot of other things: a web hosting plan, updating plugins, monitoring auto-updates so your siteâ€™s template and functionality donâ€™t break, a MySQL database, dealing with being a target for hackers, a lot of clicking around and fussing with settings, hacking Thesis, and on and on. <!-- flesh the previous sentence out with links --> For a personal website that features just few pages, a CV, and maybe a place to write blog posts and link to your social media accounts and departmental web pages â€“ or just experiment around with the awesomeness of HTML5 <!-- flesh this out with links to codepen stuff or --> and the amazing things you can do with client side scripting <!-- ahem, more links -->, WordPress is bloated.</p>

<p>Do I really need to make a database call to serve an About page with less than 500 words on it? No. Do I want a bunch of third-party scripts from whatever plugin author(s) just to have social sharing tools? No. Do I want to have to hack PHP in an existing WordPress template to adjust the banner for my logo or to just simplify the user experience? No. I still want to be able to get up and running in less than five minutes, but canâ€™t it be a little lighter?</p>

<p>So I made a wishlist of the things I wanted for a personal website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simplicity</li>
  <li>good performance and reliability</li>
  <li>no databases</li>
  <li>hosting to be free or really cheap</li>
  <li>a custom domain</li>
  <li>the ability to work on my site from anywhere if needed</li>
  <li>to use open source tools supported by an active development community</li>
  <li>to get up and running quickly</li>
  <li>to have version control on my website, preferably Git</li>
  <li>to be able to share my code so others can easily re-use it</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://staticgen.com/">There are a lot of lightweight CMS options out there</a>, but I fell for the GitHub + Jekyll toolchain. Itâ€™s well known and now pretty established, and the partnership it has developed with Jekyll developers (itâ€™s based in Ruby) and its use of Markdown to separate content from markup just seemed to click with me as a digital publisher. It may not be for everybody, but after an afternoon playing around with and getting over the learning curve, I think it can be for a lot more than developers.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why after building my site from scratch (along with the help of Bootstrap), Iâ€™ve finally taken it a step further and created a <a href="/guides/github-pages/" title="Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub">beginnerâ€™s guide to getting started building and hosting a personal website and blog with GitHub Pages and Jekyll</a>. It is very step-by-step. The goal is to make GitHub and Jekyll more accessible to a wider audience interested in an alternative to WordPress. It even refactors code to teach you how Jekyll templates work. And I should note, it was created to accompany a workshop I gave during <a href="http://ttc.iss.lsa.umich.edu/ttc/enriching-scholarship/">University of Michiganâ€™s 2014 Enriching Scholarship Conference</a>.</p>
