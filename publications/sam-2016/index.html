	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		In this work we present a new method of controlling the order
		growth of polynomial matrices in the multiple shift second
		order sequential best rotation (MS-SBR2) algorithm which
		has been recently proposed by the authors for calculating
		the polynomial matrix eigenvalue decomposition (PEVD)
		for para-Hermitian matrices. In effect, the proposed method
		introduces a new elementary delay strategy which keeps all
		the row (column) shifts in the same direction throughout each
		iteration, which therefore gives us the flexibility to control
		the polynomial order growth by selecting shifts that ensure
		non-zero coefficients are kept closer to the zero-lag plane.
		Simulation results confirm that further order reductions of
		polynomial matrices can be achieved by using this direction-fixed 
		delay strategy for the MS-SBR2 algorithm.
