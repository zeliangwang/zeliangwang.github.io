	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		Polynomial singular value decomposition (PSVD)
		plays a very important role in broadband multiple-input
		multiple-output (MIMO) systems. One of its applications lies
		in the decoupling of MIMO convolutive mixing channel matrix
		in order to recover the transmitted signals corrupted by the
		channel interference (CI) at the receiver. In this paper, a novel
		algorithm, known as multiple shift second order sequential best
		rotation (MS-SBR2), is proposed to compute the approximate
		PSVD of the broadband MIMO channel matrix. Experimental
		examples, including a measured (2 Ã— 2) optical MIMO channel
		impulse response using the multi-mode fiber (MMF) testbed, are
		presented to examine the proposed algorithm. Bit error rate
		(BER) performances are evaluated among different transmission
		schemes. In addition, power allocation (PA) schemes are investigated 
		to further optimize the BER performance.
