	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		Within the last years the multiple-input multiple-output
		(MIMO) technology has revolutionized the optical fiber
		community. Theoretically, the concept of MIMO is well
		understood and shows some similarities to wireless MIMO
		systems. The interference in broadband MIMO systems can
		be removed by applying a spatio-temporal vector coding
		(STVC) channel description and using singular value
		decomposition (SVD) in combination with signal pre- and
		post-processing. In this contribution a newly developed SVD
		algorithm for polynomial matrices (PMSVD) is analyzed and
		compared to the commonly used SVD-based STVC. The
		PMSVD is implemented by an iterative polynomial matrix
		eigenvalue decomposition (PEVD) algorithm, namely the
		second order sequential best rotation algorithm (SBR2). The
		bit-error rate (BER) performance is evaluated and optimized
		by applying bit and power allocation schemes. For our
		simulations, the specific impulse responses of the (2 Ã— 2)
		MIMO channel, including a 1.4 km multi-mode fiber and
		optical couplers at both ends, are measured for the operating
		wavelength of 1576 nm. The computer simulation results
		show that the PMSVD could be an alternative signal
		processing approach compared to conventional SVD-based
		MIMO approaches in frequency-selective MIMO channels.
