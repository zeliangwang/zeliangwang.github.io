	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		Polynomial matrix singular value decomposition (PMSVD) plays a very important role in broadband 
		multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. It can be used to decompose a broadband MIMO channel matrix in
		order to recover the transmitted signals corrupted by the channel interference (CI) at the receiver. In this
		contribution newly developed singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm for polynomial matrices are
		analyzed and compared in the application of decomposing optical MIMO channels. The bit-error rate (BER)
		performance is evaluated and optimized by applying bit and power allocation schemes. For our simulations,
		the specific impulse responses of the (2 Ã— 2) MIMO channel, including a 1.4 km multi-mode fiber and optical
		couplers at both ends, are measured for the operating wavelength of 1576 nm.
