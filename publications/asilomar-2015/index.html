	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		In this paper, we present a new multichannel spectral factorization algorithm 
		which can be utilized to calculate the approximate spectral factor of any 
		para-Hermitian polynomial matrix. The proposed algorithm is based on an
		iterative method for polynomial matrix eigenvalue decomposition (PEVD). 
		By using the PEVD algorithm, the multichannel spectral factorization problem 
		is simply broken down to a set of single channel problems which can be 
		solved by means of existing one-dimensional spectral factorization algorithms. 
		In effect, it transforms the multichannel spectral factorization problem into
		one which is much easier to solve.
