	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		The second order sequential best rotation (SBR2)
		algorithm was originally developed for achieving the strong
		decorrelation of convolutively mixed sensor array signals. It was
		observed that the algorithm always seems to produce spectrally
		majorized output signals, but this property has not previously
		been proven. In this work, we have taken a fresh look at the SBR2
		algorithm in terms of its potential for optimizing the subband
		coding gain. It is demonstrated how every iteration of the SBR2
		algorithm must lead to an increase in the subband coding gain
		until it comes arbitrarily close to its maximum possible value.
		Since the algorithm achieves both strong decorrelation and optimal subband coding, 
		it follows that it must also produce spectral
		majorisation. A new quantity Î³ associated with the coding gain
		optimization is introduced, and its monotonic behaviour brings
		a new insight to the convergence of the SBR2 algorithm.
