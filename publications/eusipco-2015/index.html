	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		In this paper, we present an improved version of the second
		order sequential best rotation algorithm (SBR2) for polynomial matrix 
		eigenvalue decomposition of para-Hermitian matrices. The improved algorithm 
		is entitled multiple shift SBR2 (MS-SBR2) which is developed based on 
		the original SBR2 algorithm. It can achieve faster convergence than the original
		SBR2 algorithm by means of transferring more off-diagonal energy onto 
		the diagonal at each iteration. Its convergence is proved and also 
		demonstrated by means of a numerical example. Furthermore, simulation results 
		are included to compare its convergence characteristics and computational 
		complexity with the original SBR2, sequential matrix diagonalization (SMD) 
		and multiple shift maximum element SMD algorithms.
