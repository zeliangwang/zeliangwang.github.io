	<h4>Abstract</h4>
	<p>
		Polynomial matrix singular value decomposition (PSVD) plays a very important 
		role in broadband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. It can be 
		used to decompose a broadband MIMO channel matrix in order to recover the
		transmitted signals corrupted by the channel interference (CI) at the receiver. 
		In this paper, a novel algorithm, known as multiple shift second order 
		sequential best rotation (MS-SBR2), is proposed to compute the approximate PSVD. 
		Simulations are implemented under a (2 Ã— 2) optical MIMO channel model. Bit
		error rate (BER) performances are evaluated among different transmission schemes. 
		In addition, power allocation (PA) scheme is investigated to further optimize the BER performance.
