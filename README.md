***

Data for my personal website `zeliangwang.github.io`, including customization of `Bootstrap 3.0`; Blog and pages generated by `Jekyll`; Hosted on `GitHub Pages`.

### Usage
***

#### To host this website on a local server for development and test purpose, simply follow the steps below:
1. Create a new `Gemfile` in the root directory if it doesn't exist:

```bash
bundle init
```
2. Edit the `Gemfile` and add `Jekyll` as a dependency:
```bash
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'jekyll'
```
3. Run `bundle` to install Jekyll for the project:

```bash
bundle update
bundle install
```

4. Build and serve the website via `http://localhost:4000`:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

#### To host this website on `GitHub Pages`:

1. Edit the `Gemfile` and replace `jekyll` with `github-pages` such that:
```bash
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
```
2. Run `bundle` to update:

```bash
bundle update
```

3. Commit and push to your remote GitHub repository:

**NOTE:** If you fork or re-use this project, please be sure you:

* Edit `_includes/analytics.html` and either
  * Replace the Google Analytics tracking code with your own, or
  * If you don't use Google Analytics, comment the block of code out entirely.
* Edit `_includes/disqus.html` and either
  * Replace the `disqus_shortname` with your own DISQUS username, or
  * If you don't want commenting, remove or comment out the block of code entirely.

Otherwise I will receive GA data and DISQUS comments from your website.
